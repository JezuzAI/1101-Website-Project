Chess is a strategic board game that involves two players and is played on an 8x8 grid known as a chessboard. Each player controls 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces have distinct movements, and the goal is to place the opponent's king in a position known as "checkmate," where it cannot escape capture.

The game begins with the pieces arranged in specific positions, and players take turns moving one piece at a time. Chess is often seen as a game of skill and strategy, as players must think ahead and plan moves to outmaneuver their opponent. It is a game of both attack and defense, requiring players to consider their own objectives while countering the moves of their opponent.

Chess has been played for centuries and is enjoyed worldwide as a competitive game, mental exercise, and an intellectual challenge.
